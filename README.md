## Basic description
Demo about connecting to Azure Analysis Server via C# using different methods and performing classic queries. We will be working with classic [official libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/client-libraries?view=asallproducts-allversions).

In order to connect to the AAS you will need an [Azure](https;//www.azure.com "Azure Homepage") account. You can follow the following [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-create-server "AAS tutorial").

We will be working with sample model Adventure Works Internet Sales. To add the model to the service, follow [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-create-sample-model) tutorial.
